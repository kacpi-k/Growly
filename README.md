The application was created for the purpose of completing a course requirement at university. Unfortunately, it still has several bugs, numerous shortcomings (e.g., lack of user feedback in the form of dialogs), and in certain places, quite extensive spaghetti code. However, after the semester ends, I plan to finalize it and enhance it with additional features. I also intend to release it as my first application on the Google Play Store.
