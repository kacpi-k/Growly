The application was created for the purpose of completing a course at university. Unfortunately, it still has a few bugs, some shortcomings, and in certain places, quite a significant spaghetti code. However, after the semester ends, I plan to finalize and enrich it with additional features. I also consider releasing it as my first application on the Google Play Store.
